# django-vagrant-box
Django-1.7 + Vagrant + Best practices from *Two Scoops of Django*.

Guaranteed to save a week's worth of developer time and a year's
worth of headaches. Enjoy!

### Getting Started with Vagrant
Whether you're creating a full-fledge web application or working with multiple developers,
it is highly recommended to use a vagrant box as your development environment.

##### Two Simple Setup Steps
1. See the [Development Setup](https://github.com/codenameyau/django-vanilla/wiki/Development-Setup)
to configure your project.
2. Follow the [Vagrant Setup](https://github.com/codenameyau/django-vanilla/tree/master/vagrant#vagrant-centos-7) to create your Django Vagrant box.

### Choosing Settings File
The default settings file used is `vanilla.settings.base`. You can configure
which settings file to use with command line arguments or with environment variables.

See the [Choosing Django Settings wiki page](https://github.com/codenameyau/django-vanilla/wiki/Choosing-Django-Settings).
