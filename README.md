Django boilerplate with best practices from Two Scopes of Django.

This Django-1.7 boilerplate should save you a week's worth
of developer time and a year's worth of headaches. Enjoy!

### Getting Started
Install requirements with: `pip install -r development.txt`
Generate `secrets.json` and run `./manage generate_secret_key`

### Choosing Settings File
The default settings file used is `vanilla.settings.base`. You can configure
which settings file to use with command line arguments or with environment variables.
See the [Choosing Django Settings wiki page](https://github.com/codenameyau/django-vanilla/wiki/Choosing-Django-Settings).

### Vagrant
Whether you're creating a full-fledge web application or working with multiple developers,
it is highly recommended to use a vagrant box as your development environment.
See the [Vagrant wiki page](https://github.com/codenameyau/django-vanilla/wiki/Vagrant).
